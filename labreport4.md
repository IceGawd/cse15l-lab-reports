# Step 4
## Keypresses
`<up><enter>`
## Explaination
The last command run locally was the SSH, so doing up and enter will give me access. Since we set up passwordless SSH, I don't even have to type a password.

# Step 5
## Keypresses
`<ctrl+v><enter>`
## Explaination
In my current clipboard, I have saved the command "git clone https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-s23/lab7", so pasting it and then running it is all that is needed.

# Step 6
## Keypresses
`cd l<tab><enter>bash t<tab><enter>`
## Explaination
The lab7 directory is the only directory in home that has an 'l' as the starting character so we can tab autofill. Similarly, test.sh is the only file with 't' as the beginning in the lab7 folder so we can tab autofill as well.
